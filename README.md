# subdomainhunt
This is small script to find subdomains
I wrote this script to make things simple it is a simple script used to find subdomains of domain
#here you only require a subdomains collection file 
#installing
git clone https://github.com/bhanugoudm041/subdomainhunt/
after cloning the repository simply give the excutable permissions to the script using this command
chmod +x subdomainhunt.sh
then run the script
./subdomianhunt.sh
after runnint the script you need to the domain name first
then after you need to enter the full path to the subdomains collection file you can use seclists also
then the output will be stored to subsoutput.txt
#thankyou.....
